### Date created
This project and its README file was created in May 2023.

### Project Title
The title of the project is Bike Share Data Analysis with Python.

### Description
In this project, I make use of Python to explore data related to bike share systems for three major cities in the United Statesâ€”Chicago, New York City, and Washington. 
I wrote code to import the data and answer interesting questions about it by computing descriptive statistics. 
I also wrote a script that takes in raw input to create an interactive experience in the terminal to present these statistics.

### Files used
There is a .py file which contains the codes used for this project.

### Credits
I would like to give credit to Udacity for the Programming for Data Science with Python course.
I would also like to give credit to Kevin Stratvert for his Youtube tutorial on Git and GitHub.
