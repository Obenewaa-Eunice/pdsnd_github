### Date created
This project and its README file was created in May 2023.


### Project Title
The title of the project is Bike Share Data Analysis with Python.


### Description
1. In this project, I make use of Python to explore data related to bike share systems for three major cities in the United Statesâ€”Chicago, New York City, and Washington. 

2. I wrote code to import the data and answer interesting questions about it by computing descriptive statistics. 

3. I also wrote a script that takes in raw input to create an interactive experience in the terminal to present these statistics.

##Statistics Computed
In this project you will learn about bike share use in Chicago, New York City, and Washington by computing a variety of descriptive statistics. In this project, I wrote codes to provide the following information:

#1 Popular times of travel (i.e., occurs most often in the start time)

most common month
most common day of week
most common hour of day

#2 Popular stations and trip

most common start station
most common end station
most common trip from start to end (i.e., most frequent combination of start station and end station)

#3 Trip duration

total travel time
average travel time

#4 User info

counts of each user type
counts of each gender (only available for NYC and Chicago)
earliest, most recent, most common year of birth (only available for NYC and Chicago)


### Files used
There are three datafiles namely chicago.csv, washington.csv and new_york_city.csv that were used in the project. 

There are two .py files which contains the codes used for this project. Either of them can be used for the needed analysis. 

# The Datasets
The data used was provided by Motivate, a bike share system provider for many major cities in the United States, to uncover bike share usage patterns.

Randomly selected data for the first six months of 2017 are provided for all three cities. All three of the data files contain the same core six (6) columns:

. Start Time (e.g., 2017-01-01 00:07:57)
. End Time (e.g., 2017-01-01 00:20:53)
. Trip Duration (in seconds - e.g., 776)
. Start Station (e.g., Broadway & Barry Ave)
. End Station (e.g., Sedgwick St & North Ave)
. User Type (Subscriber or Customer)

The Chicago and New York City files also have the following two columns:

. Gender
. Birth Year
 


### Credits
I would like to give credit to Udacity for the Programming for Data Science with Python course.

I would also like to give credit to Kevin Stratvert for his Youtube tutorial on Git and GitHub.
